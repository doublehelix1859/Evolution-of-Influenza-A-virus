#All the R codes used is for building boxplots summarizing the changes in frequency of major and minor variants(amino acid) 
 of influenza A/H1N1 pdm virus overtime(Day0 to Day7) sampled from Ferret study (Ted Ross'(Dept. of Infectious disease at University of 
 Georgia) study on "Trasmission and diversity of Influenza A/H1N1pdm in Ferret")

#The RNA samples were collected from nasopharyngeal swab of the ferrets infected by the virus and amplified by RT-PCR and seqeunced on
 Illumina Miseq platform.
